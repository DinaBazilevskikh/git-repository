Why would you offer her name
To the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothin'
And, honey, if nothing's gained
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
