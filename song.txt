There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
